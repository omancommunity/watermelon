# Introduction :

This project divided into few sections every section contain few steps,
 that will make your pi able to run simple GUI app in python with splash 
 and all other friends.


## Sections:
- [üëçüèª]Prepare system .
- [ü§ö] UI build .
- [ü§ö] Test code & Real world test .
  

# Section One:
## Prepare system :

- Download raspian lite version .<br/><br/>
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

<br/><br/>

Make sure it is lite version since we want only black console only .

---

After download the respian make sure to mount it using
any application can mount the img .

Next, create wifi config file for auto detect your wifi password
after first boot in case you don't connect your board
to lcd or monitor with hdmi .

To create wifi config file create new file and past the
following information of your router :

```bash
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
# in my case I am form oman put your country code
country=OM

network={
 ssid="WIFI NAME"
 psk="WIFI PASSWORD"
}
```
save it as ```wpa_supplicant.conf``` and move the
file into mounted raspian os on your Computer .
Also create file with name ```ssh``` and move it to 
raspian os on your Computer without any extension just ssh .
to <b>enable</b> ```ssh``` .


unmout ```sdcard``` form your comupter and put it in your 
pi and boot the raspberry pi .


to look around for ip of your raspberry pi you can 
use any application to lookup for ip on your router .

or just use router setting to figure out the raspberry pi
local ip .

In my case I will use arp-scan .

```bash
# using  arp-scan with sudo in mac and linux
$ sudo arp-scan --lcoal
# catch up ip and copy it and start use ssh
$ ssh pi@your_local_ip
# password for raspberry pi 
# raspberry
```

after connected to pi using ssh, we will do some simple
configuration around including adding new user and password, change password and 
download few packages .


to create new user:

```bash
$ sudo  nano /etc/apt/sources.list
# and remove hash from last source list 
# deb-src http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/ buster main contrib non-free
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt list --upgradeable
$ sudo apt dist-upgrade 
$ sudo adduser python
# add python user to sudo group 
$ sudo adduser python sudo
$ sudo usermod -a -G adm,dialout,cdrom,sudo,audio,video,plugdev,games,users,input,netdev,gpio,i2c,spi python
$ echo 'python ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/010_python-nopasswd
$ sudo nano /etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd
# outputpi to python
# change 
# pi ALL=(ALL) PASSWD: ALL
# add simple firewall
$ sudo apt install ufw
$ sudo ufw allow 22
$ sudo ufw allow ssh
$ sudo ufw limit ssh/tcp
# change hostname 
$ sudo raspi-config
# form wifi hostname change raspberrypi to salalah-hacker
# finish and reboot system 
```

after second boot i install necessary packages .

```bash
$ sudo apt install python-setuptools libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libfreetype6-dev xorg openbox obconf xserver-xorg-video-fbdev python-smbus python3-smbus python-dev python3-dev python3-serial i2c-tools tk-dev python3-tk python3-pip samba samba-common-bin cmake git fbi python3-venv  -y
# change samba server  details & password
$ sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

```bash
[salalah-hacker] 
     comment= Salalah Hacker 
     path=/home/python 
     browseable=Yes 
     writeable=Yes 
     only guest=no 
     create mask=0777 
     directory mask=0777 
     public=no
```

```bash
# add password to samba server
$ sudo smbpasswd -a python
# finally add samba role to firewall & restart samba server
$ sudo ufw allow samba
$ sudo ufw reload
$ sudo service smbd restart
```


### Create Splash Screen :

```bash
# install fbi
$ sudo apt install fbi
# create directory where our splash image 
$ cd ~ && mkdir others && cd others && mkdir splash && cd ~
```

after that open any application can manage art with image ```W 480 x H 320```
in my case I will use sketch application .

![alt text](Screen Shot 2020-05-11 at 3.38.41 AM.png)

open new terminal and copy image you just create to raspberry pi :

```bash
$ scp watermelon_splash.png python@192.168.8.135:/home/python/others/splash/
# disable tty
$ sudo systemctl disable getty@tty1
```

Now create new service call it splashservice and paste the following :


first create service file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/splashscreen.service
```

now copy/paste the following:

```bash

[Unit]
Description=Splash screen
DefaultDependencies=no
After=local-fs.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/fbi -d /dev/fb1 --noverbose -a /home/ayoob/others/splash/splash.png
StandardInput=tty
StandardOutput=tty

[Install]
WantedBy=sysinit.target

```


activate our service :

```bash
$ sudo systemctl enable splashscreen
# test our splash
$ sudo systemctl start splashscreen
```
keep in mind this will display only non animated image so gif will not work and I don't recommand but it can be , but here I will
use non-animated image simple png .

# Section Two:
## UI build (UI for our application for above last code can be include here if you want):

So our screen lcd here is 3.5 inch lcd 480 x 320 I buy it from amazon you can also from here .
<br>
https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Cooling-Heatsink-320x480-Monitor/dp/B07WRV48ZW
<br>
to make lcd work you should add few things to work properly .
Connect to your raspbery pi then & make sure git already installed then:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/goodtft/LCD-show.git
$ chmod -R 755 LCD-show
$ cd LCD-show/
$ sudo ./MHS35-show
```

in case you don't have lcd or monitor with hdmi just do the following :
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/goodtft/LCD-show.git
$ cd LCD-show
$ sudo cp ./usr/mhs35-overlay.dtb /boot/overlays/
$ sudo cp -rf ./usr/99-calibration.conf-mhs35  /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-calibration.conf
$ sudo cp -rf ./usr/99-fbturbo-fbcp.conf  /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbturbo.conf
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/tasanakorn/rpi-fbcp
$ sudo mkdir ./rpi-fbcp/build
$ cd ./rpi-fbcp/build/
$ sudo cmake ..
$ sudo make
$ sudo install fbcp /usr/local/bin/fbcp
$ sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-evdev
$ sudo cp -rf /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/45-evdev.conf
```



change ```/boot/config.txt``` :

```bash
$ sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```

and copy/past following :
```bash
dtoverlay=mhs35-overlay
hdmi_force_hotplug=1
hdmi_group=2
hdmi_mode=1
hdmi_mode=87
hdmi_cvt 480 320 60 6 0 0 0
hdmi_drive=2
```

change ```/boot/cmdline.txt``` :
```bash
$ sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
```

and copy/past following (make sure to add in same line with space only):

```bash
fbcon=map:10 fbcon=font:ProFont6x11 logo.nologo
```

```bash
# fillay reboot your device
$ sudo reboot
```

Now you should be able to see our splash screen .

ü§ù you have configure properly your raspian os as we need excpect few
other package and simple configure for next step we will 
go through .
