This project still in development.

# Introduction :

This project divided into few sections every section contain few steps,
 that will make your pi able to run simple GUI app in python with splash 
 and all other friends.


## Sections:
- [üëçüèª]Prepare system .
- [ü§ö] UI build .
- [ü§ö] Test code & Real world test .
  


# Prepare system :

- Download raspian lite version .<br/><br/>
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

<br/><br/>

Make sure it is lite version since we want only black console only .

---

After download the respian make sure to mount it using
any application can mount the img .

Next, create wifi config file for auto detect your wifi password
after first boot in case you don't connect your board
to lcd or monitor with hdmi .

To create wifi config file create new file and past the
following information of your router :

```bash
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
# in my case I am form oman put your country code
country=OM

network={
 ssid="WIFI NAME"
 psk="WIFI PASSWORD"
}
```
save it as ```wpa_supplicant.conf``` and move the
file into mounted raspian os on your Computer .
Also create file with name ```ssh``` and move it to 
raspian os on your Computer without any extension just ssh .
to <b>enable</b> ```ssh``` .


unmout ```sdcard``` form your comupter and put it in your 
pi and boot the raspberry pi .


to look around for ip of your raspberry pi you can 
use any application to lookup for ip on your router .

or just use router setting to figure out the raspberry pi
local ip .

In my case I will use arp-scan .

```bash
# using  arp-scan with sudo in mac and linux
$ sudo arp-scan --lcoal
# catch up ip and copy it and start use ssh
$ ssh pi@your_local_ip
# password for raspberry pi 
# raspberry
```

after connected to pi using ssh, we will do some simple
configuration around including adding new user and password, change password and 
download few packages .


to create new user:

```bash
$ sudo  nano /etc/apt/sources.list
# and remove hash from last source list 
# deb-src http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/ buster main contrib non-free
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt list --upgradeable
$ sudo apt dist-upgrade 
$ sudo adduser python
# add python user to sudo group 
$ sudo adduser python sudo
$ sudo usermod -a -G adm,dialout,cdrom,sudo,audio,video,plugdev,games,users,input,netdev,gpio,i2c,spi python
$ echo 'python ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/010_python-nopasswd
$ sudo nano /etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd
# outputpi to python
# change 
# pi ALL=(ALL) PASSWD: ALL
# add simple firewall
$ sudo apt install ufw
$ sudo ufw allow 22
$ sudo ufw allow ssh
$ sudo ufw limit ssh/tcp
# change hostname 
$ sudo raspi-config
# form wifi hostname change raspberrypi to salalah-hacker
# finish and reboot system 
```

after second boot i install necessary packages .

```bash
$ sudo apt install python-setuptools libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libfreetype6-dev xorg openbox obconf xserver-xorg-video-fbdev python-smbus python3-smbus python-dev python3-dev python3-serial i2c-tools tk-dev python3-tk python3-pip samba samba-common-bin cmake git fbi python3-venv  -y
# change samba server  details & password
$ sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

```bash
[salalah-hacker] 
     comment= Salalah Hacker 
     path=/home/python 
     browseable=Yes 
     writeable=Yes 
     only guest=no 
     create mask=0777 
     directory mask=0777 
     public=no
```

```bash
# add password to samba server
$ sudo smbpasswd -a python
# finally add samba role to firewall & restart samba server
$ sudo ufw allow samba
$ sudo ufw reload
$ sudo service smbd restart
```


ü§ù you have configure properly your raspian os as we need excpect few
other package and simple configure for next step we will 
go through .
